Project Report: Classification Analysis with Gaussian Naive Bayes

Objective:
The goal of this project is to perform a classification analysis using the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm on a dataset loaded from the 'otu1.xlsx' file. The dataset contains features and labels, where the labels are converted from 'Sample1' (Left/Right) to numerical values (0 for Left, 1 for Right). The analysis includes various performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and the visualization of the ROC curve.

Steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset is loaded from the 'otu1.xlsx' file.
The 'Sample1' column is encoded into numerical labels (0 for Left, 1 for Right).
Data Splitting:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using a 70-30 split ratio.
Model Training:

The Gaussian Naive Bayes model is trained on the training dataset.
Cross-validation:

Cross-validation is performed using 5-fold cross-validation to assess the model's generalization performance.
Model Evaluation:

The accuracy of the model is computed on the test set.
The confusion matrix is generated to analyze the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative values.
Classification Report:

A detailed classification report is produced, including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
ROC Curve:

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is plotted to visualize the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
Sensitivity and Specificity:

Sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) are calculated to further evaluate the model's performance.
Results:

Cross-validated scores demonstrate the model's consistency across different folds.
The accuracy on the test set indicates the overall correctness of the model predictions.
The confusion matrix provides insights into the model's performance on individual classes.
The classification report gives a detailed overview of precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
The ROC curve visually represents the model's discrimination ability.
Conclusion:

The Gaussian Naive Bayes model, trained on the given dataset, shows promising results in terms of accuracy and overall performance.
The inclusion of a detailed classification report and ROC curve analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses.
Recommendations for Future Work:

Consider exploring alternative classification algorithms to compare performance.
Investigate feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
